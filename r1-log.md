### R1D1
<!-- Started a Weather App. Worked on the draft layout of the app, struggled with OpenWeather API http://www.example.com -->

Started a simple gesture app [here](https://github.com/thesamuraiwho/simple-gesture-show). That is based on my project on another account [here](https://github.com/greenunknown/simple-gesture-slideshow) that uses PySimpleGUI. Mostly working on Pexels API. I had issues with authorization and accessing various resources but now can search and access public collections. However, original size images sometimes display black bars.

Also, I followed [Miguel Grinberg's tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-create-a-react--flask-project) to create a react flask project.
